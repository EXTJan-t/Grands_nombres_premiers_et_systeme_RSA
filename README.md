## RSA Encryption/Decryption Tool

This repository contains a simple implementation of the RSA encryption and decryption algorithm. RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. The implementation includes generating keys, encrypting text and numbers, and decrypting them back to their original form.

### Features

- **Key Generation:** Generate RSA public and private keys.
- **Encryption:** Encrypt a number or a string using the RSA algorithm.
- **Decryption:** Decrypt a number or a string encrypted by this tool.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have a `Python` installation version 3.6 or above.
